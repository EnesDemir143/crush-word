# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18)

**Core value:** Oyuncuya her zaman oynanabilir kalan, kurallari acikca gorunen ve ders dokumanindaki tum zorunlu maddeleri eksiksiz yerine getiren bir mobil kelime oyunu sunmak.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Core Gameplay and Session Results

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 8 (Core Gameplay and Session Results)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase 2 and Phase 02.1 fully completed; Phase 3 is next
Last activity: 2026-04-18 - Completed Phase 02.1-01 with trie-backed board analyzer, dead-board recovery, controller solvability gate and 14 unit tests. Manual gate approved.

Progress: [████████░░] 80%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: planning + implementation karisik; direct compare edilmemeli
- Total execution time: Tracking not normalized after inserted eval gate

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation and Shell | 3 | 1.3h | 26.7m |
| 01.1 Requirements, Architecture and Persistence Eval Gate | 3 | planning-only | n/a |
| 2. Game Setup and Board Foundation | 3 | execution tracked in summaries | n/a |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01, 02-02, 02-03, 02.1-01 (all completed)
- Trend: Phase 2 ve Phase 02.1 tamamen kapandi; board render, weighted generation, drag selection ve initial solvability gate tamamlandi. Siradaki is core gameplay (kelime dogrulama, puanlama, gravity/refill).

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- Phase 0: Yerel depolama ve paketlenmis sozluk kullanilacak.
- Phase 0: Agir framework yerine basit controller + model yaklaşimi korunmali.
- Phase 0: Kullanici adi ve hafif ayarlar `shared_preferences`, skor gecmisi/altin/joker envanteri ise `sqflite` uzerinden tutulacak.
- Phase 0: Sunum ve rapor hazirligi roadmap'in resmi parcasi olarak tutulacak.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 01.1 inserted after Phase 1: Requirements, Architecture and Persistence Eval Gate (URGENT)
- Phase 01.1 completed on 2026-04-18 and unblocked Phase 2 with explicit eval matrix + manual gate rules
- Phase 02.1 inserted after Phase 2: Initial Board Solvability Gate to pull first-render dead-board recovery earlier than the rest of Phase 4
- Phase 02-01 completed on 2026-04-18 after user-approved manual gate
- Phase 02-02 completed on 2026-04-18 with weighted board generation, session models and deterministic coverage
- Phase 02-03 completed on 2026-04-18 with board UI render, drag selection, adjacency guard and responsive width-first grid layout
- Phase 02.1 completed on 2026-04-18 with trie-backed board analyzer, dead-board recovery service, controller solvability gate and 14 unit tests
- Current next target is Phase 3 `03-01`; core gameplay starts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 ve sonrasi implementasyonlarda `01.1-EVAL-MATRIX.md` ve `01.1-MANUAL-CHECKLIST.md` zorunlu referans kabul edilmeli.
- Harf puan tablosu, joker fiyatlari ve power threshold'lari canonical source yazildigi anda kullanicyla manuel teyit gerektiriyor.
- Resume behavior, newest-first history ve kullaniciya gorunen aggregate/power/count alanlari icin feature-cikisinda kisa smoke-check gerekecek.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-18 13:53
Stopped at: Phase 2 + Phase 02.1 fully completed; next work is Phase 3 core gameplay (word validation, scoring, gravity/refill, game end)
Resume file: None
